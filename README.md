# Top-Down-Shooter

This is a top down shooting game that I used with Unity engine to create it.
This was a solo project that I spent a month creating. For this project I did
not draw the art of the game. This project has given me the experience of
creating a top down game, the movement of a top down character, shooting
mechanics and AI pathfinding.
